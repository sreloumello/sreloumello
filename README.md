<h4 align="center">My name is Luan but you can call me Lou</h4>
<h6 align="center">In the realm of Information Technology, my expertise has consistently revolved around infrastructure and systems integration projects. Presently, as a seasoned SRE/DevOps Engineer with 4 years of experience, I shoulder responsibilities encompassing the planning, implementation, support, monitoring, and automation of Cloud resources across AWS, GCP, and Azure. In the course of my work, I predominantly employ tools associated with Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD), Kanban, Automation, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Irrespective of my existing knowledge base, present me with a task, and I am committed to either resolving it with my current know-how or acquiring the necessary skills to resolve it.</h6>
